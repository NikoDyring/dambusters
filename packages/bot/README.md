# 🤖 Bot

This is an extension of the TLDR Dungeon Guide bot I currently have in progress. This one is specifically made for our guild **The Dambusters**. Therefore there will be commands designed to help us deal with management/planning.

## ❕ Available Commands

```md
# Shows how to use the bot and lists possible aliases to search for dungeons
!d, !dungeon

# Shows dungeon strategy for specified dungeon by alias
!d dos
```

## ⚙️Running the bot

```node
# watch mode
$ npm run dev

# production
$ npm run start
```

## 💡 Suggestions

I'll gladly expand the features of the bot, in case you have any suggestions feel free to hit me up. Either here or on Discord (Zake#9023)
