# 🛩️ The Dambusters

The Dambusters is a World of Warcraft guild based on the Kazzak realm.
As a software engineering student, I decided to create the website for the team as the old one we had was a piece of ancient technology. Previously we used WordPress for the website, but due to the lack of WoW-related themes, plugins and extensions, I decided now was a good time to expand upon our community and build something we could customize for our specific needs.

Who knows, this might become a CMS-candidate in the future for other guilds to appreciate.

**NOTE**: *Have in mind the software is currently under heavy development and what you see is subject to change.*

## 🎉 Future

I'm also currently working on a [discord bot](https://github.com/NikoDyring/tldr-dungeon-bot). That'll mainly be used for providing TL:DR descriptions of boss fights/ dungeon strategies for new and seasoned players in the World of Warcraft universe. Later on this might even be extended to have a cooperation with the website. Could be commands to push/add items to a collection or get links that would come from the API.
